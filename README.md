Graphs to create multi-species and single-species heterogeneous networks for use in Network Enhanced Similarity Search

These graphs can be input in any order into Network Enhanced Similarity Search, which then automatically compiles all graphs and performs its random walk with restart. 
Please note in the manuscript which graphs were used for multi-species, single species, and global single species protein-protein interaction.
